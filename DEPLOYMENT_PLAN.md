# Deployment Plan: Full-Stack Application on GoDaddy

This document outlines the steps to deploy a full-stack Node.js and Next.js application to a GoDaddy hosting environment.

**Important Note:** For best results with a full-stack Node.js and Next.js application, a **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** or a **Dedicated Server** from GoDaddy is the recommended approach. Standard shared hosting plans may not support the necessary requirements for running a Node.js server.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup on GoDaddy

This initial phase involves preparing your server environment.

*   **1.1: Choose and set up a GoDaddy VPS or Dedicated Server.**
*   **1.2: Install Node.js, npm, and a process manager (like PM2) on the server.** This will be used to keep your application running continuously.
*   **1.3: Configure production environment variables.** This includes setting up the necessary credentials for services like Supabase.

## Phase 2: Backend Deployment

Next, we'll get your backend up and running.

*   **2.1: Prepare backend code for production.** This involves configuring settings like the `PORT` and any API keys for a production environment.
*   **2.2: Upload backend code to the server.** You can use FTP, SCP, or Git to transfer your files.
*   **2.3: Install backend dependencies.** Run `npm install --production` to install only the necessary packages for the live application.
*   **2.4: Build the TypeScript backend.** Run `npm run build` to transpile your TypeScript code to JavaScript.
*   **2.5: Start the backend server using PM2.** This will ensure your backend runs in the background and restarts automatically if it crashes.
*   **2.6: Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx).** This will direct incoming traffic from a specific domain or subdomain to your backend application running on a specific port.

## Phase 3: Frontend Deployment

This phase mirrors the backend deployment for your Next.js application.

*   **3.1: Prepare frontend code for production.** Configure the frontend to communicate with your live backend API URL.
*   **3.2: Upload frontend code to the server.**
*   **3.3: Install frontend dependencies.** Run `npm install`.
*   **3.4: Build the Next.js application.** Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build.
*   **3.5: Start the Next.js server using PM2.**
*   **3.6: Set up a reverse proxy for the frontend.** Configure Nginx to serve your Next.js application.

## Phase 4: Domain and DNS Configuration

Here, we'll connect your domain to the server.

*   **4.1: Point your domain's A record to the server's IP address.** This is done through your GoDaddy domain management panel.
*   **4.2: Configure DNS for any subdomains.** For example, you might set up `api.yourdomain.com` to point to your backend.

## Phase 5: Finalization

The final steps to secure and test your live application.

*   **5.1: Configure an SSL certificate for your domain (HTTPS).** This is crucial for security and user trust. GoDaddy provides options for this, or you can use a free service like Let's Encrypt.
*   **5.2: Thoroughly test the live application.** Ensure all features, forms, and APIs work as expected.
*   **5.3: (Optional) Set up a CI/CD pipeline.** For future updates, consider setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate the deployment process.
